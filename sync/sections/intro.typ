= Introduction


== Motivation
We chose to focus on CS-scholars for our project due to the increasing importance of computer science in today's technology-driven world. The field of computer science is rapidly evolving, with new discoveries and innovations emerging constantly. By creating a comprehensive database and analysis tool for CS-scholars, we aim to:

1. Facilitate collaboration among researchers by making it easier to find experts in specific subfields.
2. Help students and aspiring researchers identify potential mentors and research groups.
3. Provide insights into research trends and the impact of various institutions in the field of computer science.
4. Offer a valuable resource for funding agencies and policymakers to make informed decisions about research support.

The importance of this application lies in its potential to accelerate scientific progress by fostering connections and providing a clear overview of the computer science research landscape.
